    UpTime.h - Arduino uptime and events in seconds

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #include <Arduino.h>
    #include <UpTime.h>     // https://github.com/jozef/Arduino-UpTime

    uptime_interval fire2(2);
    uptime_interval fire5(5,UPTIME_RIGHT_AWAY);

    void setup () {
        Serial.begin(9600);
    }

    void loop () {
        Serial.println("uptime: "+uptime_as_string()+" or "+uptime()+"s");
        if (fire2.check()) Serial.println("2s elapsed");
        if (fire5.check()) Serial.println("5s elapsed");
        delay(1400);
    }

will output:

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Uptime class is made to to track uptime of Arduino in seconds. The uptime()
or check() functions has to be called at least once for 0xFFFF seconds
(once in 18h) to work. Seconds will be counted even after Arduinos
millis() overrun and the seconds of unsigned long are enough to not overrun
sooner then in 136+ years. Once 0xFFFF0000 seconds is elapsed, will trigger
reset so that Arduino program clearly starts all over again.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 bool check()

Returns true/false if the interval elapset.

=head2 void reset(bool postpone = true)

Will reset the time to count from current moment in until interval. If
C<postpone> is set to false, check() will return true with next call.

=head1 INSTALL

    git clone https://github.com/jozef/Arduino-UpTime sketchbook/libraries/UpTime
